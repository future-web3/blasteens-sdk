## Arcade SDK
  ### Overview
  The Blasteens Arcade module leverages Redux for efficient state management, automating leaderboard maintenance and simplifying player score handling. It ensures a smooth end-to-end gaming session, encouraging developers to embrace a recommended design pattern for consistent score integration. Following a carnival-inspired rule of providing a ticket with limited chances, each tryout concludes by showcasing the player's score and the highest score of their round.
  
  > For those pursuing more ambitious projects, the [Indie-Game SDK](#indie-game-sdk) provides enhanced flexibility and customization options within the Blasteens ecosystem.)

  > The following usage example is created using _[Phaser](https://phaser.io/)_, a recommended tool for crafting arcade games on Blasteens Arcade.
 
  ### Features
- Designed to interact with Redux store for state management.
- Integrates with the Blasteens Arcade system for ticketing, leaderboard, and game flow.
- Suitable for incorporation into game development projects.
  <hr/>
- `useLives()`: Decreases the number of lives in the game.
- `startGame(callback)`: Initiates the game, checks lives, and triggers a callback if lives are available; shows the ticket window otherwise.
- `endGame(callback)`: Ends the game, allows leaderboard sync, shows the ticket window, and triggers a callback.
- `updateHighScore(score)`: Updates the game's high score in the leaderboard.
- `resetGameScore()`: Resets the game score in the leaderboard.
- `getLives()`: Retrieves the current number of lives in the game.

### Usage
The main menu is crafted for the pre-game menu experience.
```javascript
// MainMenu.js
import { createGameSDK } from "blast-game-sdk"; // import the Blasteens SDK package

export default class MainMenu extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super("MainMenu");
    this.sdk = createGameSDK("snowmanDefender"); // use sdk to build the game
  }

  /* ...rest of the code...*/

  this.input.on("pointerdown", () => {
    this.sdk.startGame(() => { // use sdk to start the game
      this.scene.start("MainGame");
    });
  });
}
```
The MainGame.js file serves as the primary scene for gameplay in the game.
```javascript
// MainGame.js
export default class MainGame extends Phaser.Scene {
  constructor() {
    super("MainGame");

    this.player = null;
    this.tracks = null;

    this.score = 0;
    this.infoPanel = null;

    this.scoreTimer = null;
    this.scoreText = null;
    this.sdk = createGameSDK('snowmanDefender') // SDK build the game
  }

  /* ...your game design... */

  create() {...}

  gameOver() {
    
    /* ...finish this round... */

    this.sdk.useLives(); // SDK would count the remaining chances for the player
    this.sdk.updateHighScore(this.score); // SDK would also store the high score
    this.sdk.endGame(() => { }); // let SDK to handle ending the game

    this.input.once("pointerdown", () => {
      this.scene.start("MainMenu"); // the game would back to menu
    });
  }
}
```
### Config
There should be a main file serving as a configuration file for the game. Kindly adhere to the provided format below.
```javascript
// main.js
export const config = {
  title: "Snowman Defender", // set up your game name
  type: Phaser.AUTO,
  backgroundColor: "#3366b2",
  physics: {
    default: "arcade",
    arcade: { debug: false },
  },
  scale: {
    parent: "gameDisplay", // ensure the parent is "gameDisplay"
    mode: Phaser.Scale.FIT,
    width: 1024,
    height: 768,
  },
  scene: [Boot, Preloader, MainMenu, MainGame], // load the game scenes
};
```
> Ensure proper setup of the asset URL by using: `this.load.setPath("../../assets/games/{your_game_key}/");`
> If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to get in touch with us.
### Deploy
Once your game development is complete, please compress your files into a zip archive and send it to us. The zip file should contain two folders: one for the game itself and another for assets, encompassing elements like images, fonts, music, etc. The folder should have the similar structure as shown below:

```plaintext
game.zip
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Boot.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainMenu.js
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Game.js
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (_other components_)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (_image files_)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sounds
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ (_sounds files_)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ (_other asset folders_)
```
> Additionally, please include a game description, and remember to incorporate the game logo located in `/assets/images`.
